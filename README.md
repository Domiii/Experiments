# Experiments
My daily Prototyping outcomes with Unity :)


# Ideas

* BOIDs
* trajectory simulation (e.g. bird diving?)
  * procedural splines?
* Tons of Procedural Generation
  * [Google: Procedural Generation Unity](https://www.google.com.tw/search?q=procedural+generation+unity&source=lnms&tbm=vid)
  * Procedural Low Poly Cities: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/57470
  * Procedural low poly worlds
   * consider: [Polydraw](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3391)
   * consider: [Build System](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84935)
  * Procedural paths/roads/rivers
  * Procedural (but pretty!) landscape
* Sprite + Mesh Fracturing
  * probably want to use [Voronoi](https://github.com/Domiii/UnityTerrainFun/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Environment/MapPartitioning.cs) to create the random partitioning
  
  
# Useful (often reusable) tools/scripts

* [SceneNavigator2D](https://github.com/Domiii/unity-crush-it/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/SceneNavigator2D.cs)
* [2D Grid System](https://github.com/Domiii/UnityGrid/tree/master/Assets/Scripts)
